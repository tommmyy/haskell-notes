naming
============

- functions and args must start with lowercase
- types must start with uppercase
- you can use ' in name:
> x'
- convention that list ends with "s"
ns xs   - lists
nss     - list of lists


layouts
=============
 
white space MATTERS! 

a = b + c
  where
    b = 1
    c = 2
d = a * 2
