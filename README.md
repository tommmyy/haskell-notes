# Introduction to Functional Programming - notes

These are my notes from the [Introduction to Functional Programming](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+FP101x+3T2015/) course.
Because the Haskell is the main language used through the course the book [Programming in Haskell ](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton/dp/0521692695)
by Graham Hutton is main supporting reference.
